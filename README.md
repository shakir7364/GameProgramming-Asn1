# Game Programming Assignment 1
This assignment is an introduction to the Unity editor. The project itself is a 2D game that introduces scripts, collision and trigger interactions, and basic player movement. It also covers the sprite renderer.

To run the game, open the build folder and run the SimpleTopDown.exe file. However, to exit the build of the game, you will have to close the program manually which you can do from either the taskbar or task manager.

To view the project in the Unity editor, open the SimpleTopDown folder using UnityHub to open it as a project.
